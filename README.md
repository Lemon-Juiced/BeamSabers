# Beam Sabers
*"Legally Distinct Sabers of Light"*  

Beam Sabers is a Minecraft mod for 1.21.1 (NeoForge) that brings customizable, color-changing energy swords to your world!

  - Great Saber (Longsword): Allows the user to lunge.
  - Curved-Hilt Saber (Rapier): Allows the user to backstep and break shields.
  - Shoto Beam Saber (Cutlass): Shorter reach but higher critical hit chance.
